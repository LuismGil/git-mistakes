# Welcome (:

I am making available some basic git commands, for all those who have doubts, I am open to comments and suggestions.

I created a Readme with the content in the three languages I know (which is my day to day environment in terms of dev communities).

### I really hope I can help you, if you need any help, please do not hesitate to contact me.
